This project is a part of the academic learning process and implemntation of a new language :PYTHON.(our choice)

The project folder contains : 
database.txt 
test2.txt 

--Test and actual data sets--
project.py test.py

1.Initially the Filter program - 'project.py' is trained with a test dataset to understand and scan the good-HAM and bad=SPAM message lanbels.

2.After successful training, the actual datab set -'database.txt' path is specified in the program and run to obtain the desored results.

3.Edit the message dataset to retest and check the results which would be written to 'output.txt'.
